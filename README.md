Quad Soundscape Generator A realtime soundscape generator for tabletop surfaces. Perceptual classifications of sound and environment are being used to get an holistic management of the sound by the user, being complemented with adaptative mapping techniques commanded by the logic engine. In this way we want to control the whole system away from the rational analysis used daily in the creation and manipulation of sound.
